Sonic Robo Blast 2 For SEGA 32X v0.1a Demo
https://ssntails.srb2.org/srb32x

Works on real hardware (best on NTSC at this time), Ares, and Kega Fusion v3.64.

v0.1a includes fixes for running the game with a Sega CD attached, as well as making the special stages a bit easier.
There is also a speed fix for PAL, although moments not in-level will still run at a reduced speed. NTSC should continue to be more performant, because not only is the PAL 32X underclocked, it is still running the game at 30hz behind the scenes despite being limited to 25fps.
